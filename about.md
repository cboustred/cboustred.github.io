My name is Chris Boustred, I work for [Great Ormond Street Hospital](http://www.gosh.nhs.uk/) Children in the [North East Thames Regional Genetics Laboratory](http://www.labs.gosh.nhs.uk/laboratory-services/genetics).

Prior to working at GOSH I studied for a PhD in Molecular, Genetic and Lifecourse Epidemiology at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/mgl-epidemiology/people/chris-boustred/)

Outside of work I *attempt* to keep fit by cycling, swimming and running.
